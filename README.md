# Spotify_clone
This project is a clone of Spotify, designed to showcase my skills in front-end development. Utilizing HTML and CSS, this application mimics the core features of Spotify, allowing users to navigate through a visually appealing interface similar to the original. This project not only highlights my ability to create responsive designs .
